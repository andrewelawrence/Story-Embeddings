# Comparative Embedding Analysis to Evaluate AI Creativity in Short Fiction

In this project I aim to visualize and quantify AIâ€™s capacity to produce meaningfully novel narratives as a poor proxy for general novelty. I will use DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B to generate 300K AI-authored short stories from the WritingPrompts dataset and embed both the AI and original human texts to compare their structure in vector space.

See `plan.md` for a detailed breakdown of the background, methodology, goals, and limitations.
